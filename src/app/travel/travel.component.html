                    There are many bus services to Milan Centrale from Bergamo Airport.
                    You could also take the bus (number 1) to Bergamo train station and from there, take a train to Arcore, 
                    with destination Milano Porta Garibaldi.
                    Although this is a more complicated,
                    it would be considerably quicker than travelling into Milan and back out to Arcore.
                    A taxi from Bergamo Airport to the train station would be a quicker and easier alternative, and would cost 17-20 euro

            <h2>By Car </h2>
        <p>If driving or renting a car, the addresses of all locations and accomodation are listed on their respective pages. 
            All recommended hotels offer free parking, as do all venues, should you not wish to avail of the coach service.
            If you do wish to book a car we recommend Europcar on Hertz. Taxis are available form all airports directly to Arcore, 
            however this is quite a pricey alternative and not recommended. There are also taxis services available for getting around in Arcore.
            We suggest to book any journeys well in advance as taxis need to be booked via phone.
