            <h2>Car Hire/Taxis </h2>
        <p>We recommend hiring a car if you plan to travel before/after the wedding.
            There will be free parking available at all hotels and veunes, should you not wish to avail of the coach service.
            If you do wish to book a car we recommend Europcar on Hertz. Taxis are available form all airports directly to Arcore.
            However this is quite a pricey alternative and not recommended. There are also taxis services available for getting around in Arcore.
            We suggest to book any journeys well in advance as taxis need to be booked via phone.
